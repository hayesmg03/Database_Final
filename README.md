COMP 405-002


Overview:

This project let's you look up and check out the information of our 6 tables that all have
information based around the 31 random video games we decided to focus on for this
project.

To run our code for our database:


First, because we are using flask app on python you will need to run the app.py file.
Then after that, you will need to type in the given ip address into your web browser.
Lastly, you will be able to type in any of our 6 table names {DevelopedBy, Developer, 
Genre, InGenre, Platforms, & VideoGame} to look up our tables 
and see what is inside of them.
